Multi-Rename Script(MRS) is open source application for massive file renaming.

MRS is not limited to finite number of rename actions so you can rename files based on any criteria and you can write your own. Its up to you if its going to be simple file name manipulation or complex one, like using database or Internet to get information about the new file name.

You can extend application using scripting language and plugins.
